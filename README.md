# 📌 Introduction
The Mini Dice Game is a simple JavaScript project created while learning the basics of web development. It generates two random dice rolls when the page is refreshed, determining a winner between two players. This project serves as a fun way to understand DOM manipulation, random number generation, and basic JavaScript logic.

# 🔧 Features
1. Randomly generates two dice numbers upon refresh.
2. Declares a winner based on the higher dice roll.
3. Simple yet effective UI using HTML and CSS.
4. No user input required; purely based on prediction and luck.

# 🚀 How It Works
1. When the page is loaded or refreshed, two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated.
2. These numbers correspond to dice images that are updated dynamically.
3. The player with the higher dice roll is declared the winner.
4. If both players get the same number, it's a draw!

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML – For structuring the web page.
CSS – For styling the UI.
JavaScript – For game logic and DOM manipulation.
